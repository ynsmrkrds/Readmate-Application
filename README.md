# Readmate Application

This is an ebook reading application. It presents the ebooks in the Gutenberg project to its users. Users can add e-books in the app to their own bookshelves, so they don't have to remember anything about the last place they read.

There is a server in the backend and on this server the [Gutendex API](https://github.com/garethbjohnson/gutendex) is running. Apart from this, user information is kept in [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
